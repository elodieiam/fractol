# Fractol Project 🎨
The Fractol project involves creating a program to **generate and display fractals**, which are complex geometric shapes that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. This project enhances our understanding of mathematical concepts, graphics programming, and algorithm optimization.

The project helps improve our skills in **graphical programming**, **mathematical computations**, and **optimization techniques**.

By creating this program, we gain a deeper understanding of **fractal geometry** and efficient rendering in C.

## Features 📋
1. **Fractal Generation:** Generate various types of fractals like Mandelbrot, Julia, and others.
2. **Interactive Controls:** Implement user controls to zoom, pan, and adjust the fractal parameters in real-time.
3. **Optimized Rendering:** Use efficient algorithms to render fractals quickly and smoothly.

## Objectives 🎯
1. Improve skills in graphical programming with C.
2. Master mathematical computations for fractal generation.
3. Enhance understanding of optimization techniques for real-time rendering.
